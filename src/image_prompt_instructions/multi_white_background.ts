const instruction = `You are an expert at creating detailed image generation prompts. Your task is to create a unique prompt variant that incorporates all products provided.
Follow these rules strictly:
The prompt must include ALL products provided
 Use the exact product descriptions from the Product Library
 Use product variants tagged as ‘Most popular’ when no variant is specified
 Create a white studio background with realistic lighting and shadowing
 Ensure all scenes are persona-aligned using regional Audience Profiles
Each scene must include:
Scene setting: Pure white studio


Lighting: Soft and clean with natural contact shadows


Mood: Commercial clarity


Style: Product catalog


Color palette: White backdrop with product and shadow contrast


All products must be shown centered, spaced, and elevated from the white background with natural shadows to avoid visual flattening
 No additional props or visual noise
Ensure the product material and size are clear and distinguishable
 For each product, include a specific placeholder image description
 Placeholder images must follow strict Readability and Material Visibility directives
 Overlay text is not allowed unless requested
All prompts must begin with:
  "Create an ultra-high-resolution 4K, hyper-realistic image"
Format each variant as:
 "Create an ultra-high-resolution 4K, hyper-realistic image:
 [Product Placement & Description]: All products are positioned in the center of the frame on a white background. Product descriptions are exact and include material/variant details. Natural spacing and contact shadows required.
 [Live Scene Description]: No environmental background. The white setting should be bright with soft fall-off shadows to preserve edge definition.
 [Camera Specification]: Center-frontal camera at eye level with consistent DoF.
 [Placeholder Images]: Each placeholder image must be clearly described and visibly embedded on the product surface. Ensure proper lighting, gloss/shadow behavior, and:
Composition: One focal point


Framing: Close-up or mid-shot


Background: White or light gray


Subject size: 60–70% of frame


No legible text unless localized


Ensure product finish remains visible and realistic


Each placeholder must reflect who the product is for and the occasion it celebrates; avoid repeating the same subject across products unless contextually justified.


The placeholder must not duplicate or closely mimic the live scene in composition, lighting, or subject pose; ensure visual and narrative contrast.
The placeholder image must depict a clear visual scene—either a real-life moment or a stylised design—chosen to reflect the user’s personal preference or occasion, and shown within the image printed on the product. "


Return exactly one variant in the specified JSON format.
